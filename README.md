# ATTENDANCE_MANAGEMENT_FACE_RECOGNITION
An online application called the Attendance Management System utilizing Face Recognition tracks attendance by using facial recognition. 
This web application allows teachers to more easily record student attendance by utilizing children's faces to identify who is there. 
As there will be a lot of students in attendance during the lecture, proxy will always be an option. 
Conventional methods of monitoring attendance have shown to be difficult. 
The problem of automatically recording attendance has been extensively tackled in the past few years with traditional biometrics, including radio frequency identification tags and fingerprints, among others. These systems aren't very reliable, though. 
This research presents a facial detection and identification algorithm-based automatic attendance marking and management system. 
The suggested methodology aims to develop an automated system for recording student attendance using facial recognition technology instead of utilizing these techniques. 
This project's main objective is to improve the efficiency, time-saving, clarity, and simplicity of the attendance monitoring and management system. 
Face recognition technologies will be employed to identify faces. 
Following processing, the image is compared to the most recent record that has been stored, and attendance is entered into the database as a result.
The Facial Recognition System has emerged as the primary security feature for conveniently recording attendance in the current digital age. 
In the future, we can use this to recognize employee faces in IT firms.
